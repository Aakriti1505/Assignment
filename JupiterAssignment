# Data Science Tools and Ecosystem

## Introduction

In this notebook, we will explore various tools and libraries commonly used in the field of data science. We will also perform simple arithmetic operations using Python code cells.

### Data Science Languages

Some of the popular languages that Data Scientists use are:

- Python
- R
- SQL
- Julia
- Scala

#### Data Science Libraries

Some of the commonly used libraries used by Data Scientists include:

- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow
- Keras
